# Calibration routines of the Spikey neuromorphic system ('spikey-calib')

Calibration routines of the Spikey neuromorphic system ('spikey-calib') developed by the
Electronic Vision(s) Group, Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics,
Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg, Germany.

For documentation, see [*HBP Neuromorphic Computing Platform Guidebook*](http://electronicvisions.github.io/hbp-sp9-guidebook/pm/spikey/calibration.html).

If working on UHEI computer cluster, please store calibration results on storage server named *ley*:

```
ln -s /ley/data/calibration/spikey/ results
```
