Spikey-calib was originally created in 2010 at Electronic Vision(s) Group,
Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics, Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg,
Germany.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made Spikey-calib that much better:

    Thomas Pfeil <tpfeil@kip.uni-heidelberg.de>
    Anne-Christine Scherzer
    Daniel Brüderle
